# Using the data from the spam email data file and using logistic regresion, create a predictive model to know if an email is spam or not. Use all the variables. (What are the significant variables and which is their order of importance?)

# Step 0: Importing libraries / installing packages:
install.packages("caTools")
install.packages("questionr")
install.packages("car")
library(caTools)
library(questionr)
library(car)

# Step 1: import the data and read the documentation 
# https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html

# Step 2: Exploratory analysis

# Step 3: Rename "crl.tot"


# Step 4: Splitting the data into train / test


# Step 5: Training the model. yesno is the dependant variable and the others are the independant. We need to recode yesno, redo the train / test and then run the model. 


# Comment: 


# Step 6: Running the test data through the model

# Step 7: Creating the confusion matrix to validate the model

# Step 8: Calculating the accuracy of our model
